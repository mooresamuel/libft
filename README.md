# Libft

Libft is a custom library written in C as part of the 42 London curriculum. It replicates a selection of standard C library functions and introduces additional functionality for handling linked lists. The project is designed to reinforce understanding of memory allocation, string manipulation, and data structures.

## Introduction

The **Libft** project involves recreating functions from the standard C library (`libc`) as well as implementing additional utility functions. It is divided into two parts:
- **Mandatory Part**: Reimplement common standard C functions.
- **Bonus Part**: Create a set of functions to manipulate linked lists.

This library can be reused in future 42 projects.

## Mandatory Functions

### Standard C Library Replications

The following functions are implemented in the mandatory part of the project:

| Function Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `isalpha`     | Checks if a character is alphabetic. |
| `isdigit`     | Checks if a character is a digit. |
| `isalnum`     | Checks if a character is alphanumeric. |
| `isascii`     | Checks if a character is an ASCII character. |
| `isprint`     | Checks if a character is printable. |
| `strlen`      | Returns the length of a string. |
| `memset`      | Fills memory with a constant byte. |
| `bzero`       | Zeros out a block of memory. |
| `memcpy`      | Copies memory from one location to another. |
| `memmove`     | Copies memory, handling overlapping regions safely. |
| `strlcpy`     | Copies a string with size limiting. |
| `strlcat`     | Concatenates two strings with size limiting. |
| `toupper`     | Converts a character to uppercase. |
| `tolower`     | Converts a character to lowercase. |
| `strchr`      | Locates the first occurrence of a character in a string. |
| `strrchr`     | Locates the last occurrence of a character in a string. |
| `strncmp`     | Compares two strings up to a specified number of characters. |
| `memchr`      | Searches memory for a specific byte. |
| `memcmp`      | Compares two blocks of memory. |
| `strnstr`     | Locates a substring within a string, up to a given length. |
| `atoi`        | Converts a string to an integer. |

### Additional Memory Management Functions

These functions use `malloc` for dynamic memory allocation:

| Function Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `calloc`      | Allocates and zeroes out memory. |
| `strdup`      | Duplicates a string by allocating memory for the copy. |

---

## Bonus Functions

In the bonus part of the project, the following linked list functions were implemented:

| Function Name      | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `ft_lstnew`        | Creates a new node with a given content. |
| `ft_lstadd_front`  | Adds a new node at the beginning of a list. |
| `ft_lstsize`       | Counts the number of nodes in a list. |
| `ft_lstlast`       | Returns the last node in a list. |
| `ft_lstadd_back`   | Adds a new node at the end of a list. |
| `ft_lstdelone`     | Deletes a node and frees its content. |
| `ft_lstclear`      | Deletes and frees a list and its contents. |
| `ft_lstiter`       | Iterates through a list, applying a function to each node's content. |
| `ft_lstmap`        | Creates a new list by applying a function to each node's content. |

## Usage

### Include the Library
To use **Libft**, include its header file in your C program:
```c
#include "libft.h"
```

### Example Usage

To demonstrate how to use some of the functions implemented in **Libft**, you can write a simple program like the following:
```c
#include "libft.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    // Example: Using ft_strlen to find the length of a string
    char *str = "Hello, Libft!";
    size_t length = ft_strlen(str);
    printf("Length of string: %zu\n", length);

    // Example: Creating a linked list node using ft_lstnew
    t_list *node = ft_lstnew("Node content");
    if (node)
        printf("Node content: %s\n", (char *)node->content);

    return 0;
}
```
Compile and run this program with:

`
gcc -o test_program test_program.c -L. -lft
`
`
./test_program
`

---

## Compilation

To build the **Libft** library, follow these steps:

1. Run the `make` command in the project directory:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. This will create a static library file named `libft.a`.

4. To clean up the object files, use:
    ```bash
   make clean
    ```

6. To remove all compiled files, including `libft.a`, use:
    ```bash
   make fclean
    ```

8. To recompile everything from scratch, use:
    ```bash
   make re
    ```

---

## Integration

To integrate **Libft** into your project:

1. Include the `libft.h` header file in your source files:
    ```c
   #include "libft.h"
    ```

3. Link the `libft.a` static library during compilation:
   ```bash
   gcc -o your_program your_program.c -L. -lft
   ```

5. Ensure the `libft.a` file is in the same directory or adjust the `-L` path accordingly.

---

## Testing

You can write your own test files to verify the behavior of the library functions. For example:

```c
#include "libft.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    // Testing ft_atoi
    char *num_str = "42";
    int num = ft_atoi(num_str);
    printf("String '%s' converted to integer: %d\n", num_str, num);

    // Testing ft_memset
    char buffer[10];
    ft_memset(buffer, 'A', sizeof(buffer) - 1);
    buffer[9] = '\0';
    printf("Buffer after memset: %s\n", buffer);

    return 0;
}
```

Compile and run this file as described in the [Compilation](#compilation) section.
